Remote.io mockup

Mock-up project for company introducing blockchain technology into job recruitment. 
Generated with the help gpt-4 through custom-built chatbot, after unsuccessful trials with Framer and its AI, which produced impressive designs but did not give access to see any of the code of the created websites. 

The prompt to gpt-4 API that generated the website is as follows:

"You are an advanced web developer whose task is to create a landing page for a startup company Reputy. Use this text in the landing page:

Job seekers: Tired of the long interview process, too many assessments and rejections?
Employers: Finding it hard to find the talent with the right level of soft-skills?
Meet Reputy: a blockchain wallet that validates soft-skills with uploaded media evidence making the hiring process simpler and faster without having to resort to time-consuming assessments. 

The website must use parallax scrolling. Show the code in HTML and CSS."
